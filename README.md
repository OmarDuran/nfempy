# Neat finite elements for python

A lightweight library for defining finite elements and simulating multiphysics is being developed as part of this exploratory project.

This project aims to provide a general, yet simple, method for using finite elements methods in Python. 

Despite the fact that the code structure is highly parallelized, it is still not a trivial task to perform in Python. The entire design can be translated to C++ as a workaround.
